# Pandas Case Studies

Welcome to my **Pandas Case Studies** repository! ðŸš€ This is a collection of various case studies from **Kaggle** where I apply and improve my **Pandas** skills through hands-on projects. Each case study focuses on real-world datasets, allowing me to sharpen my data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis techniques.

## Repository Overview

This repository is structured around multiple case studies, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis with Pandas. The goal is to continuously improve my skills and explore the capabilities of this powerful library. Below is a brief outline of what you'll find:

### Case Studies

1. **Data Cleaning**: In this study, I deal with messy datasets, handling missing data, and performing data wrangling tasks.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Here, I explore datasets to uncover insights, visualize patterns, and summarize data trends.
3. **Aggregations and Grouping**: A deep dive into how Pandas can be used to group data, apply aggregations, and generate summary statistics.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Working with time-indexed data to analyze trends, seasonal patterns, and other time-related behaviors.
5. **Data Merging and Joining**: Combining multiple datasets to derive meaningful insights from them.

### Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Manipulation**: Using Pandas to filter, sort, merge, and reshape data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
- **Aggregations**: Grouping data and calculating key statistics like sum, mean, and more.
- **Visualization**: Employing libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create insightful plots.
- **Working with Time Series**: Analyzing time-indexed data to extract trends.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For all data manipulation and analysis tasks.
- **NumPy**: Supporting numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To run and document the code interactively.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to clone or download this repository to explore the case studies. You can follow along with the notebooks or apply similar techniques to your own datasets.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apurva-Dumbare/CaseStudies_pandas.git
```

Each case study is contained within a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand the process from data loading to final analysis.

## Future Plans

- Incorporating more advanced analysis techniques, including machine learning applications with Pandas.
- Adding more case studies with a variety of datasets from different industries.
- Continuous improvement by applying feedback and learning from each project.
